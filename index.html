      <div class="welcome">
        <p>Welcome to our exploration of the world of coffee beans! Coffee is much more than just a morning pick-me-up; it's a diverse and rich experience that varies greatly depending on the type of beans used. 
            Among the countless varieties of coffee, four major types stand out for their unique characteristics: Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa. 
            Each type offers its own distinct flavor profile, aroma,
            and growing conditions, contributing to the vast tapestry of coffee culture worldwide.</p>
     </div>
       <div class="Arabica">
        <h2>Arabica</h2>
        <p>
            Arabica beans are renowned for their smooth, nuanced flavors and pleasant acidity. 
            They are often considered the gold standard of coffee beans, prized for their complexity and aromatic qualities. 
            Grown primarily in high-altitude regions with ample rainfall, Arabica beans thrive in environments with mild temperatures. 
            This type of coffee bean accounts for the majority of the world's coffee production and is favored by connoisseurs for its rich,
             fruity notes and balanced sweetness.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="Robusta">
        <h2>Robusta</h2>
        <p>
            Robusta beans are known for their bold, intense flavor and higher caffeine content compared to Arabica beans. Grown at lower altitudes in regions with warmer climates,
             Robusta plants are more resilient and disease-resistant, making them easier to cultivate. The taste profile of Robusta coffee is characterized by its strong, 
             earthy flavor with hints of bitterness. Due to its robust nature, 
             Robusta beans are often used in espresso blends and instant coffee products.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="Liberica">
        <h2>Liberica</h2>
        <p>
            Liberica beans, also known as "Liberian coffee," offer a unique and exotic flavor profile that sets them apart from other varieties.
             Native to West Africa, particularly Liberia, this type of coffee bean is prized for its distinctively fruity and floral notes, 
             often described as having a smoky, woody taste with a hint of floral aroma.
              While less common than Arabica and Robusta, Liberica beans are cherished 
              by aficionados seeking a one-of-a-kind coffee experience. </p>
       </div>
       <div class="Excelsa">
        <h2>Excelsa</h2>
        <p>
            Excelsa beans, also known as "Excelsa coffee," contribute a vibrant and exotic dimension to the world of coffee.
            Originating from Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like the Philippines and Malaysia, 
            Excelsa beans offer a unique flavor profile characterized by its fruity and tart notes, along with a hint of spiciness. 
            With a medium body and a distinctly tangy flavor, Excelsa coffee adds depth and complexity to blends, 
            making it a prized choice for adventurous coffee enthusiasts. </p>
